Using Javascript to create draggable windows with 7.css.

This thing I wrote allows you to make draggable windows with any HTML content you want. It uses [7.css](https://github.com/khang-nd/7.css), a css framework for making Windows 7-style applications.

You'll need JQuery UI and 7.css for this to work. Look at the included HTML file for an example of a working page using this JS.
